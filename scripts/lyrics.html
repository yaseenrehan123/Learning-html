        I see you, you see me
        How pleasant, this feeling
        The moment you hold me
        I missed you, I'm sorry
        I've given what I have
        I've showed you I'm growing
        The ashes fall slowly
        As your voice consoles me
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
     </pre>
